# midaeum-typescript README

This is the README for your extension "midaeum-typescript". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## Features

A resume optimizer that uses the GPT-3 LLM to automatically edit sections of your resume according to Harvard resume standards. Just highlight the portion you want edited.

## Requirements

If you want to use this youself make sure to replace API_KEY with your own open AI key.

## Known Issues

Sometimes may not match what you want so make sure you check the outputs.

## Use

For custom use I woudl recommend only using the extension.js and package.json files as the rest are boilerplate from yeoman vs code extension developement.
