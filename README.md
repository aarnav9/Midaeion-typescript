This is the README for vs code extension "midaeum-typescript".

## Features

A resume optimizer that uses the GPT-3 LLM to automatically edit sections of resume text according to Harvard resume standards. Just highlight the portion that needs to be edited.

## Requirements

Replace API_KEY with personal open AI key.

## Known Issues

Sometimes edits may not match expected output want so check edits carefully.

## Use

For custom use I would recommend only using the extension.js and package.json files as the rest are boilerplate from yeoman vs code extension developement.
